                <h4>Exceptions</h4>
                <p>
                Notwithstanding the foregoing, and as an exception to final and binding confidential arbitration, you and v1-iph14.bravogoalzimmediately.com both retain the right to pursue, in small claims court, any claim that is within that courts jurisdiction and proceeds on an individual (non-class) basis, including overdue account matters within the small claims courts jurisdiction. v1-iph14.bravogoalzimmediately.com will not demand arbitration in connection with any individual claim that you properly file and pursue in a small claims court, so long as the claim is and remains pending in that court.
                <br />
                <br />
                The following claims shall not be subject to final and binding arbitration and must be adjudicated only in the state or federal courts located in Wyoming: (i) an action by v1-iph14.bravogoalzimmediately.com relating to the infringement or validity of our proprietary rights, including without limitation, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, copyrights, trade secrets, or patents; or (ii) an action by v1-iph14.bravogoalzimmediately.com for temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive relief, whether prohibitive or mandatory, or other provisional relief, against you for breach or threatened breach of this Agreement. You expressly agree to refrain from bringing or joining any claims that are excluded from final and binding arbitration pursuant to this subsection b in any representative or class-wide capacity, including but not limited to bringing or joining any claims in any class action or any class-wide arbitration. Small claims matters may be filed in any small claims court with personal and subject matter jurisdiction over the parties. For all other matters excluded from final and binding arbitration by this subsection b, the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts located in Wyoming, and forever waive any challenge to said courts jurisdiction and venue.
                </p>
                <h4>Required Pre-Dispute Procedures</h4>
                <p>
                We acknowledge and agree that before initiating any Claim against the other, we agree to first contact the other with a written description of the dispute, which shall include all relevant documents and information, and the proposed resolution. You may send the written description of any dispute you have with us by U.S. Mail to v1-iph14.bravogoalzimmediately.com. v1-iph14.bravogoalzimmediately.com will contact you by letter at the billing address you provided to us or at the email address you provided to us. You agree to negotiate with v1-iph14.bravogoalzimmediately.com or its designated representative in good faith about your problem or dispute. If for some reason the dispute is not resolved within 60 days after receipt of the written dispute, we agree to the dispute resolution provisions below. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other term of this arbitration agreement, we will have the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in state or federal court located in Wyoming to enforce these Terms or prevent an infringement of a third-partys rights or our intellectual property rights, as stated in subsection b above. You hereby expressly consent to, and forever waive any challenge to, the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of said courts in such actions.
                </p>
                <h4>Commencing Arbitration</h4>
                <p>
                You and v1-iph14.bravogoalzimmediately.com agree to commence any arbitration proceeding within 1 year after the Claim arises (the 1 year period includes the required pre-dispute procedures set forth above) and that any arbitration proceeding commenced after 1 year shall be forever barred.
                </p>
                <h4>Arbitration Location</h4>
                <p>
                If the amount in controversy is $500 or less, then the arbitration may be conducted by telephone or by written submissions. Otherwise, the arbitration shall be conducted in Wyoming unless v1-iph14.bravogoalzimmediately.com otherwise agrees to arbitrate in another forum requested by you.
                </p>
                <h4>Organization, Rules and the Arbitrator</h4>
                <p>
                We each agree that any and all Claims other than those exempted under subsection b above shall be submitted to final and binding confidential arbitration before a single arbitrator of the American Arbitration Association (AAA). Either party may commence the arbitration process by submitting a written demand for arbitration with the AAA, and providing a copy to the other party, within the time period set forth in subsection d above. The arbitrator shall be selected by agreement of the parties or, if the parties cannot agree, chosen in accordance with Rules of the AAA. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the AAAs Consumer Arbitration Rules, in effect at the time of submission of the demand for arbitration. The AAAS Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, construction, validity, applicability, or enforceability of these Terms, the Privacy Policy, and this arbitration provision. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether any dispute is arbitrable. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether this arbitration agreement can be enforced against a non-signatory to this agreement and whether a non-signatory to this agreement can enforce this provision against you or v1-iph14.bravogoalzimmediately.com.
                </p>
                <h4>Fees</h4>
                <p>
                Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAAs Rules.
                </p>
                <h4>Governing Law and Award</h4>
                <p>
                The arbitrator shall follow the substantive law of the State of Wyoming without regard to its conflicts of laws principles. Any award rendered shall include a confidential written opinion and shall be final, subject to appeal under the FAA. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
                </p>
                <h4>Enforceability</h4>
                <p>
                This provision survives termination of your account or relationship with v1-iph14.bravogoalzimmediately.com, bankruptcy, assignment, or transfer. If the class action waiver is deemed unenforceable (i.e., unenforceability would allow arbitration to proceed as a class or representative action), then this entire arbitration provision shall be rendered null and void and shall not apply. If a portion of this arbitration provision (other than the class action waiver) is deemed unenforceable, the remaining portions of this arbitration provision shall remain in full force and effect.
                </p>
                <h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
                <p>
                Failure or any delay in enforcing this arbitration provision in connection with any particular Claim will not constitute a waiver of any rights to require arbitration at a later time or in connection with any other Claims except all Claims must be brought within the 1 year limitation period set forth above. This provision is the entire arbitration agreement between you and v1-iph14.bravogoalzimmediately.com and shall not be modified except in writing by v1-iph14.bravogoalzimmediately.com.
